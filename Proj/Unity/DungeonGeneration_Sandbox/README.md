# Dungeon Generation Sandbox
Projects/Scripts made in and for the Unity game engine for learning more about procedural generation. 
Currently adding documentation and formatting. 
Updating older scripts with newer knowledge.
Currently in process for most of these. Some scripts, such as the dungeon generations enemy movement, require
externally obtained A* pathfinding packs.
